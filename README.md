# tic-tac-toe
 
Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as (Xs and Os), is a game for 2 players.
The players can select wich mark (from 2 available) they would like to play with (X or O).
When the game starts there is drawn a grid from 9 cells on the screen.
Each player have to put their mark (depending on what they have choosen to play with) by turn on the grid.
The player that first manages to fill one whole column, row or one of the diagonals with his mark wins! :)
Enjoy playing! ;)
